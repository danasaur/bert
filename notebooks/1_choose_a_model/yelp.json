    "text": "As someone who has worked with many museums, I was eager to visit this gallery on my most recent trip to Las Vegas. I was very disappointed. The gallery is small and the majority of the exhibits are not well done. The most interesting exhibit was a collection of old photographs of Las Vegas. The rest of the exhibits were poorly done and not very interesting. The gallery is located in a small shopping center and is not easy to find. I would not recommend this gallery to anyone.",
